1. demo-diaggaussian does not seem to work:

$ python demo-diaggaussian.py 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "demo-diaggaussian.py", line 32, in <module>
    posteriormodel.resample_model(labels_jobs=2)
TypeError: resample_model() got an unexpected keyword argument 'labels_jobs'


2. moviepy seems missing?


$ python animation.py 
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "animation.py", line 49, in <module>
    from moviepy.video.io.bindings import mplfig_to_npimage
ImportError: No module named moviepy.video.io.bindings


3. not all the demos finished on my laptop (Mac OS X) but perhaps I didn't wait long enough.  "python demo.py" seems to work but after mean field it just kind of hangs.  Same with "EM_demo.py". 


4. the tests for pybasicbayes won't be discovered by:

python -m unittest discover pybasicbayes

but maybe you want users to depend on nose instead?
